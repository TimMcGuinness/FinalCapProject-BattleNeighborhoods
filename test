DATA PLANNING
2. A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (15 marks)

Using the Data: The goal for clustering data, in this case, is to identify neighborhoods that have the right business or locations in place that can benefit from “Pop-up Outside Spaces,” since the pop-up structures are an add-on to a current site. 

It can also help identify the type of marketing plan based on the number of locations that match up for each product/neighborhood mix. For groups with a larger number of locations, like gyms, the plan would be to use direct and digital marketing. For smaller target groups, like parks and hotels, it would identify that using a personal sales manager may be the better choice.  

The first step would be to build the target businesses by identifying venue categories that would match up for each product. For instance, the categories “gym” and “Gym/fitness” are just starters; we also need to find other businesses where people do physical exercise.  

My data analysis approach to the data:
There are two approaches to using the data. First, analyze neighborhoods against each other using all 229 categories. If our target categories show up at the top of these lists, then these will be are Tier 1 targets since they are the top for this category in the city. Then, second, analyze the neighborhoods using a sub-set of the categories that we selected. This will still identify key target areas but at a Tier 2 level.


NEXT STEPS - WHAT TO DO WITH THE DATA

The key to the clustering data provides me insights into where I should market my new company based on the highest concentration of the business types listed below. I then chose venue categories that fell into these categories. Note – I’m sure we can debate ALL of the categories that can be included under each business type, but I chose a selection to make sure that I could generate actionable data.
